**NOTE: we dont rebase or merge anything from master in to gh-pages branch. We treat them as completely seperate.**

* We run `npm install multiview -g` in the npm setup task cause for some reason multiview doesnt work again after it first runs and you stop it with ctrl+c. Installing it globally works though.
