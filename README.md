# MarkSearch
A Bookmarking App

For chrome extension - Remember to mention that the reason we need permission to all sites is because we can not know ahead of time
what ipv4 address the MarkSearch server will use, and we need permission to access that address to send http
requests to it. - (note - it's all sites on http, not https as the MarkSearch server does not run on https)

Make sure i mention how to open the settings via the system tray/menu bar - make sure to include a small screenshot for windows/mac/linux system tray/menu bar

Also put a note that it may take a few minutes for the email to arrive for the token/bookmarklet

REmember to mention that you can search by site and date filter

Remember to mention about the extensions that search by site and date filter also works

Put a note in the readme that sometimes the emailed bookmarklet takes a few minutes to arrive
