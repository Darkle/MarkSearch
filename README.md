# MarkSearch
A Bookmarking App

For chrome extension - Remember to mention that the reason we need permission to all sites is because we can not know ahead of time
what ipv4 address the MarkSearch server will use, and we need permission to access that address to send http
requests to it. - (note - it's all sites on http, not https as the MarkSearch server does not run on https)

Make sure i mention how to open the settings via the system tray/menu bar - make sure to include a small screenshot for windows/mac/linux system tray/menu bar

Also put a note that it may take a few minutes for the email to arrive for the token/bookmarklet

REmember to mention that you can search by site and date filter

Remember to mention about the extensions that search by site and date filter also works

Put a note in the readme that sometimes the emailed bookmarklet takes a few minutes to arrive

For the extensions, rememeber to say that the extension respects date filters & searching by site

Mention that if they have the results box set to be on the left on google, that it will always be hidden, even if you have it set to auto show on page load (cause it would always obscure the google results)

For extension, remember to mention that you can click on the MarkSearch link at the top of the results box on the search enging to open the results in the MarkSearch server search page (its the light grey MarkSearch text up the top of the MS results box)

Remember to add info about keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+M) to show/hide the MarkSearch results box

Also info about searching MS in the omnibox

Add info about choosing the search type (instant or non instant)

Make a note that the extension should work ok with google search pages that have RTL languages

Note that at the moment it doesnt support quoting to make the search more accurate - the current search is `from "fts" where fts match '"tech news" OR ("tech" AND "news")'`

Note that the bookmarklet may not work on some sites due to CSPs
