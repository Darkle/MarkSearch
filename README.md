# MarkSearch
A Bookmarking App

For chrome extension - Remember to mention that the reason we need permission to all sites (http) is because we can not know ahead of time
what ipv4 address the MarkSearch server will use, and we need permission to access that address to send http
requests to it.

### Help

##### Setting Up The MarkSearch Browser Extension
