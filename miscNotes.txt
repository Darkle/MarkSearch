* To get set up:
1 Clone repo
2 Install node-gyp requirements: https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation
  Note: for windows setup, if you use the `npm install --global --production windows-build-tools` option it will not
  add python to the PATH. The easiest way to fix, is after installed windows-build-tools, download the python 2.7 installer
  from python homepage and enable the add python to PATH feature in the installer window.
3 run `npm run initialSetup`
4 Then if you want to do some development, just run `npm start` or if you want to package, run one of the npm package
  scripts like `npm run packagelinux64`

* Scripts/Gulp Tasks to run:
  'npm nsp' - runs nsp check which runs https://www.npmjs.com/package/nsp
  'npm test' - runks synk test https://snyk.io/project/1a7ece78-9528-4e3a-9590-afc3d23c20fb/
  'npm ban' - checks for sensitive files in repo https://github.com/bahmutov/ban-sensitive-files

* Some urls to try that have issues saving: https://gist.github.com/Darkle/26c453d6778adeaf2f84c6c53e2bfe16

* Note: may need to swap over electron-prebuilt to electron in the future: http://electron.atom.io/blog/2016/08/16/npm-install-electron
  - if that's the case, remember to update references in the code to where we use the electron-prebuilt version number
    in code and in npm/gulp scripts

* Consider switching to using https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder rather than electron-packager as it can do produce
  windows installers and seems to do MacOS apps with code signing.

* When doing a new release, double check the jekyll code points to the latest release download. - can always fall back to using js to do it, can access the jekyll metadat in js too
