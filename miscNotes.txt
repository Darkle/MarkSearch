* knex relies on sqlite3 so must install & build sqlite3 node module before install knex
* When setting up dev on another mac, for some reason the sqlite3 binaries i have in repo
    arent working for compiling sqlite3 node module against them (fts5 module not found)
    so seem to need to build sqlite3 on new mac and then pass that into npm sqlite build.
    So make sure hombrew has the version we want, then do:
    `brew install sqlite3 --with-fts5`,
     then build sqlite3 node module using:
    `npm install sqlite3 --save --build-from-source --sqlite=/usr/local/Cellar/sqlite/versionWeAreUsing`
