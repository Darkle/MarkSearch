* knex relies on sqlite3 so must install & build sqlite3 node module before install knex
* When setting up dev on another mac, for some reason the sqlite3 binaries i have in repo
    arent working for compiling sqlite3 node module against them (fts5 module not found)
    so seem to need to build sqlite3 on new mac and then pass that into npm sqlite build.
    So make sure hombrew has the version we want, then do:
    `brew install sqlite3 --with-fts5`,
     then build sqlite3 node module using:
    `npm install sqlite3 --save --build-from-source --sqlite=/usr/local/Cellar/sqlite/versionWeAreUsing`
* Combinations that I know work:
  sqlite3@3.1.2 --save --build-from-source --sqlite=/usr/local/Cellar/sqlite/3.11.0/
* for sqlite@3.1.3, if you get an error of "Cannot find module '/node_modules/sqlite3/lib/binding/
    electron-v0.37-darwin-x64/node_sqlite3.node'", try using a symlink in the
    "/node_modules/sqlite3/lib/binding/" folder. So create a symlink for the node-v47-darwin-x64
    folder and name the symlink electron-v0.37-darwin-x64
* stick with got version 5 so it works in the browser (if there is a need to upgrade, info here: http://bit.ly/1Xe6sPZ)
    but may as well stick with got version 5
* maybe the sqlite corruption occurs when I'm ading stuff to pages db and i also have it open in the
    sqlite browser?
