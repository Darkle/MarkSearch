* To get set up:
1 Clone repo
2 run `npm run initialSetup`
3 Then if you want to do some development, just run `npm start` or if you want to package, run one of the npm package
  scripts like `npm run packagelinux64`

* Scripts/Gulp Tasks to run:
  'npm nsp' - runs nsp check which runs https://www.npmjs.com/package/nsp
  'npm test' - runks synk test https://snyk.io/project/1a7ece78-9528-4e3a-9590-afc3d23c20fb/
  'npm ban' - checks for sensitive files in repo https://github.com/bahmutov/ban-sensitive-files

* Some urls to try that have issues saving: https://gist.github.com/Darkle/26c453d6778adeaf2f84c6c53e2bfe16

* Note: may need to swap over electron-prebuilt to electron in the future: http://electron.atom.io/blog/2016/08/16/npm-install-electron
  - if that's the case, remember to update references in the code to where we use the electron-prebuilt version number
    in code and in npm/gulp scripts
